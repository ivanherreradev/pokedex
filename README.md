# Pokedex

This project aims to create a Pokémon Explorer application using React, which retrieves data from the PokeAPI to display information about all Pokémon species. The application allows users to browse through the Pokémon collection, filter Pokémon by their types, and view detailed information about each individual Pokémon.

### Features:

- PokeAPI data: The project uses the PokeAPI, a RESTful API that provides complete data about Pokémon species. Through requests to the API, the application obtains the necessary information.

- Pokémon collection display: The application presents a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface to display all Pokémon species. It provides a grid layout that displays the Pokémon cards, showing the name, image and types of the Pokémon.

- Filter Pokémon by type: Users can filter the Pokémon collection based on their types. The app offers a drop-down or selection mechanism where users can choose a specific type, such as Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc. After selecting a type, the application dynamically updates the displayed Pokémon to show only those that belong to the selected type.

- Detailed Pokémon information: When a user clicks on a Pokémon card, the application displays a separate page presenting detailed information about the selected Pokémon. This includes its name, image, types, weight, height, base statistics provided by the PokeAPI.
